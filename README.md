## Hands-on MLFlow: managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle in practice
### Organized by SIT Academy & SDS 2022

MLFlow is one of the most popular tools to manage the machine learning lifecycle from the beginning to the end. In this one-day workshop, we propose to guide you through the various ways you can use this platform to track, package, deploy and share your models.

As the pressure increases to bring models to production as fast and reliably as possible, the practices of machine learning operations (MLOps) are becoming the standard for data-driven companies. However, the abundance of tools to manage each aspect of the machine learning pipeline can appear daunting. 

In this workshop, we focus on MLFlow, an open-source platform that proposes solutions for the four primary pain points when it comes to managing the full machine learning life cycle:

  - tracking metadata on your running experiments,
  - packaging data science code in a reusable way,
  - managing and deploying models
  - model versioning and sharing

We propose a day-long, hands-on tutorial to introduce MLFlow tools through examples and exercises.

### Target audience
Data scientists, statisticians, and AI enthusiasts who have developed machine learning models using Python and want to gain practical experience in managing the machine learning lifecycle, end-to-end. A preparation document will be provided a few weeks before the workshop.
